## Overview

This was the prototype [UMDF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/wdf/overview-of-the-umdf) driver code I used when testing the [DRV2605](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/drv2605.pdf) haptic device from Texas Instruments ages ago. This code doesn't build/work anymore using the recent Visual Studio versions. I'm putting this one out as reference.
